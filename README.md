# Game where you play as ghost and fighting evil souls 

Demo https://iviv122.itch.io/safe-to-scare 

Was made with Godot 4.5 (stable)

Made for Hack Club Siege week 9, topic spooky 

Took too big scale for such game and it came out out as it is 

Graphics are... weak point of this game

# What the game about?

Game is about surviving as long as you can 

collect treasures

kill enemies

choose weak curses to stay longer

# Perfomance concerns and code quality

First try will be laggy

# P.S for reviewer

I hope this will fulfill spooky topic. My art skills are too bad to make something more impressive 

# a lot of hardcode
# code is very redunant
